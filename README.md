## 📝 Overview

This repository contains the full implementation of a machine-learning workflow designed to:

1. **Predict telecom customer churn**, and
2. **Estimate associated electronic-waste (e-waste) generation** using a sustainability-aware model.

We extend standard churn modeling by linking predicted churn events to environmental impact using the formula:

[
E = \frac{M \times N}{L}
]

Where:

* **M** = device mass (kg),
* **N** = number of churned customers (assumed one device per customer),
* **L** = average device lifetime (years).

This project is based on the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset and incorporates improvements to Logistic Regression alongside comparisons with SVM, XGBoost, and MLP.

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Complete Preprocessing Pipeline

* Missing value repair
* One-hot encoding
* Log transforms for skewed variables
* Tenure binning
* SMOTE oversampling

### ✔ Machine Learning Models

Baseline comparison includes:

* Logistic Regression
* SVM (Linear)
* XGBoost
* MLP Neural Network

### ✔ Logistic Regression Optimization

Improved using:

* **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameters (C, class_weight)
* **Threshold tuning** (0.10–0.90)
* **SMOTE-balanced training set**

### ✔ E-Waste Sustainability Analysis

Uses churn predictions to estimate annual e-waste, grounded in Brett Robinson’s ICORD model for global e-waste flows.

### ✔ Contract-Type Environmental Impact

Month-to-month customers produce **80%+ of predicted e-waste**, demonstrating a strong link between subscription structure and sustainability impact.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jehosua97/ML-customer-churn-prediction.git
cd ML-customer-churn-prediction
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If SMOTE causes import errors:

```bash
pip install imbalanced-learn
```

## ▶️ Running the Model

Use Python to execute the full pipeline including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and e-waste estimation:

```bash
python churnModel.py
```

This will generate:

* Classification metrics
* Confusion matrices
* Comparison tables
* E-waste estimates
* Contract-type churn breakdown
* Saved figures (if you output them to `figures/`)

## 🌍 Sustainability Layer: E-Waste Formula

We incorporate the ICORD-validated model:

[
E = \frac{M \times N}{L}
]

Using:

* **M = 0.8 kg** (router mass)
* **N = predicted churners**
* **L = 5 years** (average lifetime)

This allows the ML model to estimate **kg/year of e-waste generated by churn behavior**.
